Whenever a civilization comes into contact with visitors and their sophisticated technologies, which the less advanced civilization does not understand, a situation is created known as the "God effect". Another term for it is "cargo cult". This is how the visitors came to be worshipped as "Gods" or other supernatural beings by such tribes and peoples.

The Kayapo tribe in Brazil worship a being called Bep-Kororoti - "astronaut-like" god today symbolized by a straw man - and recite its messages - more proof of a living mythology that, to this day, relates information from a dark past.

In Colombia small "plane-like" objects of pure gold have been found. The way the wings of these objects had been arranged and their upright tail fin prompted the Aeronautical Institute in New York to start wind-tunnel experiments. Dr. Arthur Poyslee came to a positive conclusion as to the objects' ability to fly. One of these gold models has been reconstructed in a true-to-life fashion, with a wingspan of 87 cm. On August 26, 1996, this model took to its first remotecontrolled solo flight, which lasted several minutes - its performance was convincing and successful in all flight attitudes. An achievement made possible by German engineers. Designer: Peter Belting. Concept by: Dr. Algund Eenboom and Conrad Lübbers.

Would it be possible that even ancient Biblical reports might serve as historical sources? The prophet Ezekiel witnessed a "celestial vehicle" and described its many different technical details. As a matter of fact, Ezekiel himself traveled in it and was taken to a strange temple like building. When reconstructing this account, it becomes apparent that both the description of the vehicle and of the hangar-type building could have been based on facts.

*--- The brochure contains a list of quotations from the book of Ezekiel that mention celestial vehicles. ---*

If we came into contact with a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization, would we be able to grasp their world and not consider it "magical"? Or would WE take the role of the natives?
