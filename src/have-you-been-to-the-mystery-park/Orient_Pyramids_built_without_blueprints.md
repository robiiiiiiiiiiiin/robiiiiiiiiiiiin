**Orient: Pyramids built without blueprints**

Even with today's engineering tools, it would be next to impossible to build pyramids like those of Giza near Cairo. Especially the Cheops pyramid, simply known as the Great Pyramid, is a mystery

Realizing today that astronomical coordinates were incorporated into the structure of the Great Pyramid - and maybe into all of the pyramids of Giza - is an eye-opener: almost like "messages in a bottle" traveling through time. Are we able to decipher these messages today and to understand the code? Could it be that the choice of location for the pyramids was not random?and phenomenon of stone.

Gods were portrayed as real beings, even though they were superbeings - but always in direct contact with the priests. They were the masters deciding on life and death, and they even created the most outrageous hybrid beings - the horror visions of today's genetic engineering. The sphinx, half man and half lion, is only one example. Holy bulls were creatures that were buried in the largest sarcophagi mankind has ever seen (in Saqqara).
