In the "Contact" brochure, there is a paragraph about the Incan Golden Airplanes.

Some golden miniature "airplanes" have been found in Colombia. Some say that these are miniature representations of ancient aircraft while some says these are just representations of birds and fish.

The Mystery Park brochure mentions Arthur Poyslee, Peter Belting, Algund Eenboom and Conrad Lübbers.
Arthur Poyslee was the first to claim, in the 70's, that these artifacts were actually able to fly. 20 years later, the three other guys built exact replicas increased in size by a factor of 16 and equipped them with engines and radio control systems. In 1997 they performed a flight test at the Ancient Astronauts Society World Conference and the replicas were actually able to lift off, fly and perform maneuvers. The obvious conclusion was that the Inca objects were proven to be actual replicas of 100% functional aircrafts.

This website ([kimcampion.com](https://kimcampion.com/aliens-metaphysics/)) writes about this and I personnaly find this website really cool in a goofy conspiracy theorist way.

Peter Belting, Algund Eenboom and another guy even wrote a book about this subject: "Die Flugzeuge der Pharaonen: antike Flugtechniken in drei Kontinenten" (The Pharaohs' Aircraft: Ancient Flight Techniques on Three Continents). The description is lovely:
*" [...] Ancient engineers did not use primitive flying machines, but rather highly efficient, state-of-the-art aircraft similar to those used today in space shuttles. [...] Small gliders were already flying in the realm of the pharaohs over 2300 years ago. [...] A functioning miniature jet engine shows that any village blacksmith in ancient Egypt could have manufactured engines. [...] This book presents the evidence of their functionality*
