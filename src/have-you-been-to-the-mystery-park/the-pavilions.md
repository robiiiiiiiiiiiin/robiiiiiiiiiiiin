The main attractions were located in the pavilions at the end of each branches.
Each attraction had a specific theme, always related to conspiracy theories, ancient civilizations, extraterrestrials, etc.
It was often about the ancient astronauts theory.

The attractions were more like what 4DX is today than rollercoasters. It has a setup where you were sometimes sitting, sometimes standing, there were some physical props and a lot of special effects using lights, lasers, holograms amd smoke.
Then it was a kind of documentary, narated by a voice-over, that was explaining the mystery and the theories surrounding it.
And at some point, there were always aliens involved.
