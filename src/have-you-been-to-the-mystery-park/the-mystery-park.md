I'm kind of obsessed with this amusement park.

I went there three times when I was a kid. I always went with my father, and thinking back on it, I'm not sure it was really responsible of him to take his children to a supposedly scientific place that was actually promoting conspiracy theories. BUT, I LOVED IT, I loved this place. It had a "La soirée de l'étrange" vibe. It looked like something out of a movie like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Contact or ZATHURA.

And what drives me crazy is that NOBODY seems to know about this place. It has become a recurring question when I meet someone: "Have you been to the mystery park ?" and I never met someone who even heard about it.
If you went there, or if you just knew about it, please tell me, write me on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/robiiiiiiiiiiiin) and tell me.
