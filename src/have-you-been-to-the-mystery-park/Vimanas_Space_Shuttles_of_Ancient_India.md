**Vimanas: Space Shuttles of Ancient India**

Ancient Indian writings tell of flying "vimanas". Sanskrit texts documented not only general stories of ancient flying, but also the descriptions of flying machines itself. At least 20 passages in the Rigveda refer to flying machines - three floors high, triangular and three-wheeled with enough room to carry several passengers.

> *"A machine that moves by its own power like a bird, whether on land, in water or in the air, is called a vimana. You, the gods, know the secret of building flying machines."*

The fact is that many of the ancient traditions contain technical and scientific knowledge that has only been discovered in our time with the help of modern methods and instruments. What were the sources of knowledge in ancient India? Where did the documented astronomical knowledge, the calculations of planetary sizes and orbits, and the mysterious fact that even information about star trails from the universe has been handed down come from?

Who taught the Indians mathematics and physics - including facts on the age of the universe and the speed of light?
