It is (was) located in Interlaken, in Switzerland. It still exists today, but it has been renamed and transformed into a kind of gigantic kindergarten and the attractions have been closed.

The building still bears witness to the cultist / conspiracy / bizarre / alien vibe it had.
The building is shaped like a round space station with heights branches going from its center with a circle going through the branches. At the center stands a tower overlooked by a big globe, a kind of control tower.
At the ends of each branches stands a themed building that all looks different. The most noticeable are the egyptian pyramid and the mayan temple.
