# Build on nicolasgay which is built on Test 11ty 🦝🎈 :)
yeah
Nothing is up to date

## 📝 Todo
- Optimisation des images récupérées depuis Contentful
- Add JS minification
- 404

## 💿 Installation and build / run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run watch` or `npm run build`

## 👾 How it works
### Styling
The project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
### JS
At the moment, every file in the `src/_assets/js` folder are simply copied in the build directory using `addPassthroughCopy()` in `eleventy.config.js`.
### Image optimisation
`eleventyImageTransformPlugin` automatically generates multiple image sizes and formats (webp, abif, jpg) at build time.  
When you use an `<img>` tag, it will automatically generate a `<picture>` element with the full srcset etc.
  
Images fetched from Contentful should not be handled by `eleventyImageTransformPlugin`. To do this, you need to add `eleventy:ignore` to the `<img>` tag.
### Public folder
The `src/_public` folder is used to store static files that should be copied to the build directory.  
It can be useful if an image doesn't need to be optimised, or if you want to use a file that is not handled by Eleventy (like a favicon, robots.txt, etc.).
### Environment variables
The project uses dotenv to set environment variables.  
The variable is set in the `package.json` scripts.
.env.dev is loaded when running `npm run watch` and `.env.prod` is loaded when running `npm run build`.  
The code is not minified in dev mode, etc
### Data fetching
The data files are in the `src/_data` folder.  
This project uses Contentful as a headless CMS. The [contentful JS library](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.js) is used to fetch the data.  
  
You need to add thos data in `.env.local`
```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE=...
CONTENTFUL_ACCESSTOKEN=...
```
